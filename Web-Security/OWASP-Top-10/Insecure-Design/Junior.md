# OWASP Top 10: Insecure Design — Junior / Entry Level

4. What is threat modeling? — Identifying threats and mitigations early.
5. What is a trust boundary? — Where trust changes in a system.
6. Why are secure defaults important? — Users rarely change defaults.
7. What is a security requirement? — A defined control to reduce risk.
8. What is defense in depth? — Multiple layers of controls.
9. What is rate limiting and why is it design-level? — It mitigates abuse at the system level.
10. What is least privilege in design? — Restricting access by default.
11. What is a security baseline? — Minimum controls for systems.
12. What is a misuse case? — A negative user story.
