# OWASP Top 10: Cryptographic Failures — Junior / Entry Level

1. What is encryption vs hashing? — Encryption is reversible; hashing is one-way.
2. What is salting a password hash? — Adding random data before hashing.
3. Why is MD5 or SHA1 unsafe for passwords? — Too fast and vulnerable to cracking.
4. What is TLS? — Protocol that secures data in transit.
5. What is plaintext storage risk? — Data exposure if storage is accessed.
6. What is a weak cipher? — Outdated or broken encryption algorithms.
7. Why is hardcoding keys dangerous? — Keys can be extracted from code.
8. What is key rotation? — Periodically replacing encryption keys.
9. What is base64? — Encoding, not encryption.
10. What is an IV/nonce? — Random value used to make encryption safer.
11. Why is certificate validation important? — Prevents MITM attacks.
12. What is a self-signed certificate risk? — Trust can be spoofed.
13. What is weak randomness? — Predictable random values.
14. What is an HSM? — Hardware module for key protection.
15. What is a KMS? — Managed key management service.
