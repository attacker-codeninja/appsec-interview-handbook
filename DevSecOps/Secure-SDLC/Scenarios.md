# Secure SDLC — Scenarios

1. A critical vuln is found days before release. How do you decide? — Risk assessment and release gate.
2. A team ignores security findings. What do you do? — Escalate and set SLAs.
3. You are migrating to microservices. How do you keep SDLC secure? — Shared libraries and policy-as-code.
4. A feature is built without threat modeling. How do you respond? — Quick model and backlog mitigations.
5. A team uses a new framework. How do you reduce risk? — Baseline security review.
6. A legacy app has many findings. How do you handle? — Prioritize and segment.
7. A production incident reveals missing logs. What do you change? — Logging requirements and tests.
8. Security tests slow down CI. How do you optimize? — Parallel scans and targeted tests.
9. A vendor library has a zero-day. How do you respond? — Patch, monitor, and mitigate.
10. Developers store secrets in code. How do you fix? — Secrets scanning and vaulting.
11. A product team needs to bypass a gate. What do you do? — Temporary exception with compensating controls.
12. A bug bounty report lacks details. How do you handle? — Reproduce and engage reporter.
13. An org adds new compliance requirements. How do you adapt SDLC? — Update controls and training.
14. A new API is launched without DAST. What do you do? — Run tests and add to pipeline.
15. A major refactor changes auth. What do you do? — Threat model and security regression tests.
