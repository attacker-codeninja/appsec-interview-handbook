1. How do you define security-relevant events? — Auth, access, data changes, admin actions.
2. How do you design structured logs? — Use consistent fields and JSON format.
3. How do you balance logging and privacy? — Redact PII and limit sensitive fields.
4. How do you build actionable alerts? — Use thresholds and context to reduce noise.
5. How do you detect brute force or stuffing? — Rate-based alerts and anomaly rules.
6. How do you protect log integrity? — Write-once storage and access controls.
7. How do you ensure coverage in microservices? — Shared logging libraries and standards.
8. How do you handle log retention for compliance? — Set policies and archival.
9. How do you measure monitoring effectiveness? — MTTD and alert precision.
10. How do you correlate events across systems? — Correlation IDs and centralized SIEM.
11. How do you detect data exfiltration? — Monitor unusual data access patterns.
12. How do you secure access to logs? — RBAC and audit trails.
13. How do you detect insider threats? — Monitor privileged actions and anomalies.
14. How do you tune alert rules? — Review false positives and adjust thresholds.
15. How do you automate incident response? — Use SOAR and playbooks.
