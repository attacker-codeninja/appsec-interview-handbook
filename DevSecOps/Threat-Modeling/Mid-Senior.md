1. How do you prioritize threats in large systems? — Risk scoring and business impact.
2. How do you model microservices? — Focus on trust boundaries and shared services.
3. How do you integrate threat modeling into SDLC? — Early design reviews and checkpoints.
4. How do you handle third-party risks in models? — Include vendor flows and contracts.
5. How do you quantify risk for leadership? — Likelihood x impact with clear scenarios.
6. How do you use STRIDE for APIs? — Map threats to endpoints and data flows.
7. How do you avoid threat model fatigue? — Keep models minimal and actionable.
8. How do you validate model assumptions? — Pen tests and security reviews.
9. How do you incorporate privacy (LINDDUN)? — Add privacy-specific threats.
10. How do you handle cloud shared responsibility? — Map controls to provider vs customer.
11. How do you document mitigations? — Link to tickets and owners.
12. How do you handle dynamic systems? — Continuous threat modeling.
13. How do you evaluate compensating controls? — Effectiveness vs risk reduction.
14. How do you use PASTA phases? — Business objectives to technical threats.
15. How do you measure threat model success? — Reduced incidents and resolved risks.
