# OWASP Top 10: Software and Data Integrity Failures — Junior / Entry Level

1. What is software integrity? — Ensuring code is not modified maliciously.
2. What is data integrity? — Ensuring data is not tampered with.
3. What is a supply-chain attack? — Compromising dependencies or build tools.
4. What is dependency confusion? — Pulling malicious packages from public registries.
5. What is an unsigned update risk? — Updates can be tampered with.
6. What is deserialization? — Converting bytes into objects.
7. Why is unsafe deserialization risky? — It can lead to code execution.
8. What is a build artifact? — Output of the build pipeline.
9. What is code signing? — Verifying code authenticity.
10. What is a checksum? — Hash used to verify integrity.
11. What is a CI/CD pipeline? — Automated build/test/deploy flow.
12. What is a package registry? — Source for dependencies.
13. What is a signed container image? — Image with verified signature.
14. Why is pinning dependency versions important? — Prevents unexpected changes.
15. What is a provenance record? — Evidence of how a build was produced.
