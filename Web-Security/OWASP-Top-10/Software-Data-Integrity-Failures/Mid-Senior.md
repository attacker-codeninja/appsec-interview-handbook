# OWASP Top 10: Software and Data Integrity Failures — Mid / Senior Level

1. How do you secure CI/CD pipelines? — Protect runners, secrets, and approvals.
2. How do you implement artifact signing? — Use Sigstore/Cosign in CI.
3. How do you verify software provenance? — Enforce SLSA levels.
4. How do you mitigate dependency confusion? — Use private registries and namespaces.
5. How do you secure update mechanisms? — Sign updates and verify on install.
6. How do you handle deserialization safely? — Use safe formats and allowlists.
7. How do you protect build scripts? — Review changes and lock down permissions.
8. How do you handle third-party build actions? — Pin versions and review code.
9. How do you ensure data integrity in transit? — Use TLS and message signatures.
10. How do you secure container supply chains? — Scan, sign, and verify images.
11. How do you detect tampering? — Monitor checksums and audit logs.
12. How do you handle compromised signing keys? — Rotate keys and revoke signatures.
13. How do you protect configuration integrity? — Use GitOps and signed commits.
14. How do you handle dependency updates safely? — Use lockfiles and review diffs.
15. How do you enforce integrity at deploy time? — Admission controllers and signature checks.
