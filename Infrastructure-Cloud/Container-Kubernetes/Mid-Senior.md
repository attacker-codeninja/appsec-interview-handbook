6. How do you implement image provenance? — Sign with Cosign and verify.
7. How do you secure multi-tenant clusters? — Namespaces, network policies, quotas.
8. How do you handle node hardening? — CIS benchmarks and minimal OS.
9. How do you handle supply-chain risks in images? — SCA and SBOM.
10. How do you prevent lateral movement? — Network policies and service mesh.
11. How do you implement Pod Security Standards? — Enforce baseline or restricted.
